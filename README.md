## Introduction

Welcome to the Work Day Scheduler repository! This project is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9 am to 5 pm). It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The application uses the Day.js library to handle date and time functionality.

## Features

- Display the current day at the top of the calendar.
- Present time blocks for standard business hours (9 am to 5 pm).
- Color-code time blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
- Enable users to enter events when they click into a time block.
- Save entered events in local storage when users click the save button.
- Persist saved events even after page refresh.
